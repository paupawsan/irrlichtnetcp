-Added Irrlicht's parameters to VideoDriver.EndScene (thanks to Nikolaus for
this).

fic functions depending on the mesh type
-Added AnimatedMeshX, AnimatedMeshB3D, AnimatedMeshMD2, AnimatedMeshMS3D spe-
cific routines

-Added Line2D by Kimundi
-Added a couple of improvements to the global types, thanks to Kimundi
-Added #if statment for Irrlicht.NET to compile with IrrlichtW_d debug version
-Fixed bug where retrieval of ToolTipText actually returned getText() in guielem.cpp
-Added Debug compile profile in IrrlichtW solution
-Fixed Vista string bug related to memory release of unmanaged allocated memory in IrrlichtW
-Changed Device_Drop in method Dispose() to Device_Close due to the memory corruption within glibc
-Fixed a bug in LogEvent.Text management since it caused troubles with double freeing within glibc

=============================================================================
-Added IrrlichtDevice.Close which was on IrrlichtW but not on Irrlicht .NET
-Added Matrix4.InverseRotationDegrees (Radians also).
-Corrected a huge bug with Colorf. It was using values between 0f and 255f whereas Irrlicht uses values
between 0f and 1f... You MUST now update all your softwares. (thanks to lester)
-Added Irrlicht 1.3 compatibility and libraries (refer to Irrlicht change log in the /Irrlicht SDK directory).
-Added new BillboardTextSceneNode (a composition of a TextSceneNode and a billboard)
-Added a Quaternion implementation (thanks to zitzu)
-Added GuiElement.ToolTipText, thanks to Delight on the forum.
-Added Texture.Name, thanks to zitzu !
-Added Texture.DOTNETImage to load/retrieve a System.Drawing.Bitmap from an Irrlicht texture.
-Corrected a lot of small stuff and improving .NET code speed.
-Added Irrlicht 1.3.1 compatibility.
-Added Mesh constructor and Mesh.AddMeshBuffer (thanks to Alexandre for sending this patch).
-Added support for TTFFont, all required libs for Windows and a preprocessor flag to remove using freetype library.

=============================================================================
Irrlicht .NET CP 0.7
=============================================================================
-Added SceneManager.Clear
-Added MetaTriangleSelectors
-Corrected bug with custom scene nodes' transformed bounding boxes which were
 making them disappear all the time
-Added VideoDriver.DrawMeshBuffer
-Added MeshBuffer constructor, it can be used to make external loaders
 (via VideoDriver.DrawMeshBuffer)
-Added VideoDriver.DriverType and VideoDriver.Name (and ToString methods)
-Fixed inversion between row and column on Matrix4 class. This fix won't need
 change on your code (and is based on a fix from Irrlicht SDK).
 Also optimized a bit this Matrix4 class.
-Added Vector3D.HorizontalAngle
-Added GuiSkin class and all methods (but not yet inheritable).
-Now uses Irrlicht 1.2, list of modifications :
	-Corrected a lot of enums to fit Irrlicht 1.2
	-A ton of new 'hidden' features, refer to Irrlicht 1.2 log for more info.
	-Added VideoDriver.DrawVertexPrimitiveList

=============================================================================
Irrlicht .NET CP 0.6
=============================================================================
-Added Matrix4.RotateVect, Matrix4.TransformVect
-Added Irrlicht .NET CP extensions
-Corrected SceneNodeType enumeration to fit Irrlicht 1.1
-Added Logger class
-Added GuiEnvironment.BuiltInFont
-Corrected Matrix4 to a class so that it can be instancied via new Matrix4()
-Corrected bug with DrawIndexedTriangleList / Fan
-Added CameraSceneNode.ViewFrustrum, which is almost complete
-Changed IrrlichtDevice constructor's protection level to prevent from
 creating IrrlichtDevice with an IntPtr argument.

=============================================================================
Irrlicht .NET CP 0.5
=============================================================================
-Correcting a lot of minor bugs/speed issues.
-Added Custom Scene Nodes feature and a tutorial.
-Added inheritable IAnimator which behaves as a normal Animator you can
 add to any node... Example added in the Custom Scene Nodes example.

=============================================================================
Irrlicht .NET CP 0.4.1
=============================================================================
-Organizing the wrapper as a SDK and SVN repository.
-Minor bugfixes (for instance in Line3D)

=============================================================================
Irrlicht .NET CP 0.4
=============================================================================
-Corrected F Key enumeration (thanks to Rowan Lewis)
-Added Vector2D structure (thanks to sh1ny)
-Added VideoDriver.DeleteAllDynamicLights (thanks to sh1ny)
-Added ToBCL/FromBCL methods to Color/Colorf and Rect structures. These 
 methods can be used to convert to standard .NET.
-Changed main namespace from "Irrlicht.NET" to "IrrlichtNETCP" due to several 
 issues (thanks to dmoonfire for the idea)
-Improved a lot MeshManipulator wrapper with documentation.
-Now uses Irrlicht 1.1, list of modifications :
	-Changed AddTestSceneNode to AddCubeSceneNode.
	-Added AddSkyDomeSceneNode
	-Added AddSphereSceneNode
	-Added Material type : PointCloud
	-Added Texture3 and Texture4 on Material class (also corrected GetTexture2 
	 that returned Texture1)
	-Added SceneManager.SaveScene/LoadScene
	-Added VideoDriver.CreateScreenShot and VideoDriver.WriteImageToFile. 
	 Notice that Irrlicht.NET CP's WriteImageToFile supports 
	 a lot of formats whereas Irrlicht's writeImageToFile only supports 
	 bmp for now. So you can save screenshots with this wrapper in bmp, png, 
	 jpeg, gif... Whatever !
	-Added VideoDriver.TextureCount, VideoDriver.PrimitiveDrawnCount 
	 and VideoDriver.GetTextureByIndex

=============================================================================
Irrlicht .NET CP 0.3
=============================================================================
-Adding Texture access via 3 methods : Get/SetPixel (slow), 
 Modify/Retrieve (fast and secure), unsafe code (fast and unsecure), 
 also added Texture.Save which supports jpeg, png, gif, bmp... (added a 
 tutorial on the project ShadersAndParticle)
-Adding MeshBuffer to support advanced physics
-Bugfix : Again platform-dependent and several speed issues.
-Bugfix : Stupid bug in Vector's length and Normalize null vectors.
-Bugfix : Some bool values always set to TRUE (bug with Visual Studio 8)
-Major Bugfix : Memory leaks corrected, now the memory is stable, even with 
 hundredth of emitters/affectors

=============================================================================
Irrlicht .NET CP 0.2
=============================================================================
-Adding shader support
-Adding inheritable IParticleAffector and IParticleEmitter to perform these 
 operations from .NET code
-Adding "array features" such as KeyMapping and FollowSplineAnimators
-Adding ToShader methods on common types to convert colors, vectors and 
 matrices to shader constants
-Bugfix : Platform-dependent code which did not do the same on Linux and 
 Windows

=============================================================================
Irrlicht .NET CP 0.1
=============================================================================
-Adding full Irrlicht scene, video and gui environments.
-Adding most common types such as Vector3D and Matrix4.
