==================== Emmanuel 'DeusXL' Bossiere =============================
=============================================================================

=============================================================================
Irrlicht .NET CP 0.4
=============================================================================
-Corrected F Key enumeration (thanks to Rowan Lewis)
-Added Vector2D structure (thanks to sh1ny)
-Added VideoDriver.DeleteAllDynamicLights (thanks to sh1ny)
-Added ToBCL/FromBCL methods to Color/Colorf and Rect structures. These methods can be used to convert to standard .NET.
-Changed main namespace from "Irrlicht.NET" to "IrrlichtNETCP" due to several issues (thanks to dmoonfire for the idea)
-Improved a lot MeshManipulator wrapper with documentation.
-Now uses Irrlicht 1.1, list of modifications :
	-Changed AddTestSceneNode to AddCubeSceneNode.
	-Added AddSkyDomeSceneNode
	-Added AddSphereSceneNode
	-Added Material type : PointCloud
	-Added Texture3 and Texture4 on Material class (also corrected GetTexture2 that returned Texture1)
	-Added SceneManager.SaveScene/LoadScene
	-Added VideoDriver.CreateScreenShot and VideoDriver.WriteImageToFile. Notice that Irrlicht.NET CP's WriteImageToFile supports 
			a lot of formats whereas Irrlicht's writeImageToFile only supports bmp for now. So you can save screenshots with this wrapper
			in bmp, png, jpeg, gif... Whatever !
	-Added VideoDriver.TextureCount, VideoDriver.PrimitiveDrawnCount and VideoDriver.GetTextureByIndex

=============================================================================
Irrlicht .NET CP 0.3
=============================================================================
-Adding Texture access via 3 methods : Get/SetPixel (slow), Modify/Retrieve (fast and secure), unsafe code (fast and unsecure), 
 also added Texture.Save which supports jpeg, png, gif, bmp... (added a tutorial on the project ShadersAndParticle)
-Adding MeshBuffer to support advanced physics
-Bugfix : Again platform-dependent and several speed issues.
-Bugfix : Stupid bug in Vector's length and Normalize null vectors.
-Bugfix : Some bool values always set to TRUE (bug with Visual Studio 8)
-Major Bugfix : Memory leaks corrected, now the memory is stable, even with hundredth of emitters/affectors

=============================================================================
Irrlicht .NET CP 0.2
=============================================================================
-Adding shader support
-Adding inheritable IParticleAffector and IParticleEmitter to perform these operations from .NET code
-Adding "array features" such as KeyMapping and FollowSplineAnimators
-Adding ToShader methods on common types to convert colors, vectors and matrices to shader constants
-Bugfix : Platform-dependent code which did not do the same on Linux and Windows

=============================================================================
Irrlicht .NET CP 0.1
=============================================================================
-Adding full Irrlicht scene, video and gui environments.
-Adding most common types such as Vector3D and Matrix4.
